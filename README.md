# Interview cheat sheet
Repository with a collection of links and typical interview questions for data scientists and analysts 

## Algorithms
1. Combined sorted array. As input you are given two sorted arrays with unique elements. Define and algorithm that has as output a sorted array having as elements those of the two input arrays.   
2. Fibonacci series. For any positive integer N, return the sum of a Fibonacci series having N elements.  
3. Prime number. For a given positive integer N, return True if N is a prime number, return False otherwise
4. You are given a square matrix and suppose you are at the location on top left of the matrix (index 0,0). From this location you can move only up or down for as many times as needed. Find the path towards the bottom right of the matrix that has the highest sum of the cells which are crossed.
5. You are given a ladder of N stairs. You can take steps of a given length say 1, 2 or 3 steps. How many possible ways you have to climb the full staircase? 

## Machine learning questions 
1. Describe the k-means clustering algorithm
2. What is the difference between bagging and boosting?
3. What is the difference between decision trees and random forests?
4. What are uses and advantages/disadvantages of L1 and L2 loosses?
5. When to use a neural network and when to use decision trees or any linear model?
